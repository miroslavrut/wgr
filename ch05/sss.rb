# In addition to serving automatically as the receiver for bareword messages, self also
# enjoys the privilege of being the owner of instance variables. 
# The definition of whole_name depends on the bareword method calls to first_name,
# middle_name, and last_name being sent to selfâ€”self being the Person instance
